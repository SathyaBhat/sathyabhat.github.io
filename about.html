## About


Hi, I’m Sathyajith Bhat (aka “SJ”/“SathyaBhat”/“coolpcguy”/“cpg”). I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer on the [Adobe I/O][aio] platform and the author of [Practical Docker with Python: Build, Release and Distribute Your Python App with Docker](https://u.sbhat.me/practical-docker-book) published by [Apress Media](https://u.sbhat.me/practical-docker).

Prior to this, I was the Lead Ops/SRE at [Styletag.com][st]. I transitioned to Ops/SRE after being a Lead Analyst at [CGI][cgi], working primarily on Oracle Fusion stack(Oracle DB/PL/SQL/Oracle Forms and other related middleware) designing, architecting and implementing complete end-to-end Insurance solutions for a major Insurance provider in the Nordics.

In my free time, I am part of the [Barcamp Bangalore][bcb] and [AWS Users Group Bangalore][awsugblr] organizing team. Besdies these, I’m a volunteer Community Moderator at [Super User][su] and [Web Apps Stack Exchange][webapps], honorary Administrator for [Indian Video Gamer forums][ivg] and previously have been a Moderator for Chip-India and Tech 2 forums.

I love listening to [music][lastfm] and am usually seen [playing video games][gaming](most played genres include A/RPGs, Racing and City builders).
