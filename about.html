## About


Hi, I’m Sathyajith Bhat (aka “SJ”/“SathyaBhat”/“coolpcguy”/“cpg”). I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer on the [Adobe.io][aio] platform. Prior to this, I was the Lead Ops/SRE at [Styletag.com][st]. I transitioned to Ops/SRE after being a Lead Analyst at [CGI][cgi], working primarily on Oracle Fusion stack(Oracle DB/PL/SQL/Oracle Forms and other related middleware) designing, architecting and implementing complete end-to-end Insurance solutions for a major Insurance provider in the Nordics.

In my free time, I am part of the [Barcamp Bangalore][bcb] planning team, handling DevOps and Social Media for BCB. I’m also a volunteer Community Moderator at [Super User][su] and [Web Apps Stack Exchange][webapps], honorary Administrator for [Indian Video Gamer forums][ivg] and previously have been a Moderator for Chip-India and Tech 2 forums.

Besides SQL, PL/SQL & Oracle Forms, I also know a little bit of Ruby, Python and have been dabbling in Chef off late. I love listening to [music][lastfm] and am usually seen [playing video games][gaming](most played genres include A/RPGs, Racing and City builders).
